## Eigenvalue_tracking
The Python code uses and expands upon the models from "A new class of Galerkin expansion models for the study of thermoacoustic instabilities" by Silva and Polifke to track the eigenvalues of the thermoacoustic system and it's arbitrary variations on R (Reflection coefficient of the outlet).
